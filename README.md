This is the unofficial repository from Data Youth Campus, held by Ministry of Science and ICT with Yonsei University in June ~ August, 2022.

Education consists of the 'Big Data Analysis and Processing' course (140H) and the team project (210H). I'm a leader of the team 'Coding in the Trap'. Project code will be released soon in this repository.
